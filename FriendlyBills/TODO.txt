timestamp: which should be shown as a transactions page column; entry date, the date of the transaction specified by the submitter, or both?

properly disposing of controllers/db contexts?

should account balance field be added to group model? to avoid calculating the sum everytime, and isolate the dal calls made by groupRepo and TransactionRepo

what happens if one user is in multiple groups with another user? are their balances maintained in context of each group, or combined? is this even possible

Asynchronous calls everywhere

Add rank column to user table: 2->Master 1->Admin 0->User
	1 Master per group.
	Master and Admins can invite and accept new users to group.
	Accounts can only be deleted by higher-ranking users
	Only Master can grant a user Admin privileges.
	Master can transfer mastership to any user.

Requesting to join a group:
	RegisterUserToGroup controller method gets Master and Admins from db, sends them each join request 

Notifications table: remove either timestamp or datetime column

User table: do you really need to ahve the active column int here?
	REMOVE PRIVILEGE COLUMN

Rename primary keys of tables  to just be ID instead of the name and then the id field.

Add error messages for every ERROR MESSAGE stub (see login http post controler for an example )

New layout: If users have more than one group, logging in should direct them to homepage from which they select one of their groups and loads the group view page
	If user only has one group, home page IS group view page

GroupIDs should be 4 digits to look professional
